# Miku Bot Rewrite Checklist

## New Core Structure

The core of the bot will be completely redisigned this includes:
 - **The only** Commands that still reside in the Core (aka Miku.DiscordBot) Project are Dev Commands, that are used for loading and unloading Commandmodules
 - All commands move to seperate Projects
 - Music has the least priority and will start by using Lavalink again, and later will move to VoiceNext for more compatibility with specific sites (NicoNicoDouga, BiliBili etc.)

If you're interested in how the "hotloading/unloading" of commands will work, here's an example project, or rather the base for the rewrite, which  will soon be comitted here in this new Repo

## IMPORTANT INFO
### Command modules should not have any dependencies on the Miku.DiscordBot project, same goes the other way around! No dependencies from Miku.DiscordBot to any Command Project
